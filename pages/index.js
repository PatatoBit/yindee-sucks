      <h1>A website is created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h1>
      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <p>HTML is the basic skeleton of what a website is, the order of what is. What text.</p>
      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <p>CSS is very simple, its just makes a ugly looking website looks better.</p>
      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <p>JavaScript makes everything function, a button when clicked to do what.</p>
